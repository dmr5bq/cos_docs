Styles and Guidelines
*********************

This section contains all of the information regarding styling of code written for the Open Science Framework. On a project as large as the OSF, maintaining consistent, understandable style and enforcing best practices is essential to keep the project moving forward as bug- and error-free as possible. These guides pertain to all of the programming languages that make up the OSF source code. If you run into any trouble, check out the :doc:`help` section.
