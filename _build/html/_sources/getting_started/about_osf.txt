About the Open Science Framework
================================
----

Overview
--------
The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free, open source web application that connects and supports the research workflow, enabling scientists to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their research. Researchers use the OSF to collaborate, document, archive, share, and register research projects, materials, and data. The OSF is the flagship product of the non-profit Center for Open Science.

How do people use the OSF?
-------------------------
Researchers can use the OSF to manage their projects and collaborations or register their studies.

Academic meetings and conferences can use OSF for Meetings to share the posters and slides presented at the conference with a broader audience to increase the impact of the work.

Journals can use the OSF to support data and materials sharing initiatives, or the OSF registry to support preregistration of research.

Institutions can use OSF for Institutions to provide their researchers with a free, open source scholarly commons. Institutional branding and authentication provide a seamless user experience.

Funders can use the OSF to support data and materials sharing initiatives or mandates, to broaden the impact of the work they fund.

About the Center for Open Science
---------------------------------
The Center for Open Science (COS) is a non-profit technology startup founded in 2013 with a mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. COS pursues this mission by building communities around open science practices, supporting metascience research, and developing and maintaining free, open source software tools.
